## Services

### Algo Hub

The `algo_hub` service holds various algorithms that can be utilized for algorithmic trading. New algorithms can be added to this service in the future.

### Common

The `common` service provides common utility modules that can be used across the application, including:
- `date_parser`: Utility for parsing date and time.
- `enums`: Shared enums used throughout the project.

### Data Consumer

The `data_consumer` service is responsible for consuming data from websockets and passing it to relevant functions for processing.

### Order Manager

The `order_manager` service handles the placement of orders for trades based on trade signals generated by the `signal_generator`.

### Signal Generator

The `signal_generator` service generates trade signals for each trade based on received ticks. The signal generation process is tailored for different trading algorithms.

### Trade Watcher

The `trade_watcher` service constantly observes placed orders. It determines the appropriate tick price to exit open orders based on target prices set.

### User

The `user` service manages all user-related data within the system.
